# Tree Generic with Iterators


This project implements a generic k-ary tree container that supports various types of keys, such as numbers, strings, and other classes. 
The default  is a binary tree (k = 2).
The number of children per node can be specified during the creation of the tree. 
The tree supports the iterators:

- Pre-Order Iterator
- Post-Order Iterator
- In-Order Iterator
- BFS (Breadth-First Search) Iterator
- DFS (Depth-First Search) Iterator
- Heap Iterator

The library that i was used is 
- **SFML:** for graphical of the tree.
